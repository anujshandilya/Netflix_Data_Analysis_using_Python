Netflix Movie Dataset Analysis ðŸ“ŠðŸŽ¥

Project Overview: This project involves analyzing the Netflix movie dataset to uncover valuable insights and trends. Using Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, the dataset was preprocessed, and multiple questions were addressed through visualizations and statistical analysis.

Objective: The goal is to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to understand trends in Netflix movies, such as genre distributions, release year patterns, ratings, and other factors.

Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language used for analysis.
NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive coding environment for analysis.

Workflow:
1. Data Loading: Read and explore the Netflix dataset.
2. Data Cleaning: Preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, filter out irrelevant data, etc.).
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Insights & Conclusions: Summarize the key findings based on the analysis.
